# Node/Express Portfolio

This is a portfolio website to showcase my experience, skills, and a couple of projects.

The site is built with Node.js/Express.js, with ejs as the view engine. JavaScript, HTML, Sass/CSS, and PostgreSQL are all used for this project as well. Simplicity was the goal here in regards to the tech stack choices, which is why I opted not to use a frontend framework. 

There is basic analytics tracking that utilizes a Postgres database. Page views with click data for each of those views is tracked.
